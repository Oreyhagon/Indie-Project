# Indie-Project
Game development for my first game.

Greetings friends!

My name is Amierullah Iqram, from Malaysia! I have a dream of a becoming game developer, especially indie games. However, I'm still learning how to code, and I'm really really bad at pixel art! I'm willing to learn from those experienced developers. Just be noted though, I can't promise you much with this project. On the other hand, if our project becomes a hit and starts gaining money, I promise you too will have a share of the riches! I work with my friend at the moment and I only use game maker studios 2.
